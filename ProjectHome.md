CommuniGate Pro is a super efficient multi-purpose [Internet Protocol router](http://www.communigate.com/cgatepro/Router.html) that can serve as a email MTA, but also provide services for Real-Time services such as Instant Messaging ([XMPP Jabber](http://www.communigate.com/cgatepro/XMPP.html) & [SIP/SIMPLE](http://www.communigate.com/cgatepro/SIP.html)) and SIP based Voice and Video.

The server has extreme performance due to its multithreaded single process architecture. CommuniGate Pro is a drop in replacement for Sendmail, Postfix, EXIM and many other legacy MTA servers.

This project is providing by the open-source community, a security bundle for CommuniGate Pro. This is intended to help system administrators quickly get all the right tools to mitigate abuse of messaging and realtime protocols and services.

The project has the goal to initially include support for DKIM, DMARC and tuning help for optimal performance and hardening of the CommuniGate Pro router.

  * [IPv6 to IPv4](http://www.communigate.com/cgatepro/Network.html#IPv6)
